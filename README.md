# Olker's Map based on WorkAdventure Map Starter Kit

This is Olker's first map-making, using a starter kit to help you build your own map for [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

To understand how to use this starter kit, follow the tutorial at [https://workadventu.re/map-building](https://workadventu.re/map-building).

For now, it is just ENTER and EXIT in a colourful, slightly messy space. Form follows function, ay?
